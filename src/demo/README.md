<h1>Demo Script</h1>

<p>The Notecard program is employed to demonstrate its <br />
capabilities.  Notecard execution of:  </p>

<pre><code>    scala card demo/card
</code></pre>

<p>presents a series of CardSets that either explains <br />
the feature of a particular command or it executes <br />
the command's feature. This survey of commands is a <br />
high-level review; it is not an extensive coverage <br />
of a command's capabilities.   </p>

<p>A more detail description of the script commands is <br />
found at:  </p>
