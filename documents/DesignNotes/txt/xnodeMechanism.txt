		XNodeMechanism

The following CardSet script request that the user enter 
a response and appears to provide feedback as to the correct
answer.
		c
		d 2+2 = (# $sum4)
		g ($sum4)=(4)
		d Correct
		ge 
		d Wrong, the answer is 4

Unfortunately, all the CardSet commands are executed before
the user has the opportunity to respond.  The variable '$sum4'
is empty causing the logical expression to fail.  Thus, the 
text "Wrong, the answer is 4". is displayed.

The 'eXecute' command with the tag 'x' halts the processing of
commands until the response is captured.

		c
		d 2+2 = (# $sum4)
		x                   // wait state invoked
		g ($sum4)=(4)
		d Correct
		ge 
		d Wrong, the answer is 4

Command processing begins when the Next button is
activated (wait released), and the commands:

		g ($sum4)=(4)
		d Correct
		ge 
		d Wrong, the answer is 4

are executed.  The variable '$sum4' now holds the user's
response. Again, the Next button is highlighted (wait invoked). 
Until it is activated, the user has the opportunity to read
the feedback.

###CardSet

The XNode class supports the eXecute 'x' command. This class is a  
child of CardSet.  
		
		CardSet.executeOneCardSetChild(...
			obj match {  // obj is a child object
				case rn: RowerNode=> ...
				case as: Assigner=> ...
				case cst: CardSetTasks=> ...
				case gn: GroupNode=> ...
				case xn: XNode=>
					showPanel(notePanel) 
					imputFocus.giveFocusToFirstInputField
					inputFocus.turnOnXNode
					haltCommandExecution(lock)
					...

The Display 'd' commands preceeding the 'x' command are rendered, focus is given
to the first input field, and executon of commands is halted.
