Assign Command
=============

The Assign command has an 'a' tag, followed by one or more spaces and by a   
$<variable> having a trailing equal '=' sign. The $<variable> is always the   
left-hand expression.  The expression to the right of the '=' sign is either:    

		value  
		$<variable>  
		math expression of Values and $<Variables>  

For example:  

		a $one = 22  
		a $two = $three  
		a $three = 2.123 * 5/ ( 2.1 - $fraction)  

In the math expression, numeric character strings are converted to decimals.  
The Assign Command has an optional Logic component (see Logic component).   
This component has a restriction that is not present for this component in   
the Clear, File, and Edit commands. In the case of the Assign command, the   
Logic expression must be preceded by an 'if' tag, for example:  

		a $one = 22 if ($one) > (22)  
		a $two = $three if ($four) <= ($five)  
		a $three= 2.123 * 5/ ( 2.1 - $fraction) if ($three) <> (5)
