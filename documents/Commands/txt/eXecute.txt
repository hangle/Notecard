eXecute Command
================

The eXecute command, with the tag of 'x' (no trailing space required), halts   
the execution of the Card Set and passes control to the input mechanism. When   
the input capture is complete, then control returns to execute the remaining   
Card Set.  
        
The function of the eXecute command is to capture a response and display it   
within the context of the same Card Set, for example:  

		c  
		d Enter your age (# $age)  
		x  
		d Your age is (% $age)  
		c ...  

In the above script, the input field is shown. The command 'd Your age is   
(% $age)' is not shown because execution of the Card Set has been halted. Had   
the 'x' command been missing, then the 'd' command would have executed and $age   
would have printed 'Unkwn($age)'.  

Suppose the user entered '22' for their age. Now, control returns to execute   
the 'd' command and the $age variables causes '22' to be printed.  A more   
practical application shows the value of the eXecute command:  

		c  
		d What is the capital of Ohio (# $capital)  
		x  
		g ($capital)  =  (Columbus) 
		d Correct   
		ge  
		d Wrong.  Columbus is the capital  
		c  ...  

The '* continue' command also halts the execution of the CardSet. The eXecute 'x'  
command and the '* continue' cannot reside in the same CardSet.
