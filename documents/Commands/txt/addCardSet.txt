AddCardSet
=================

An AddCardSet has the same functionality as a CardSet.  
However, it does not begin with the 'c' command. Instead,    
it begins with the '+' command; and, like the 'c' command,  
it also clears the  screen.    

The two Sets differ by their controlling button. The CardSet   
is activated by the Next button.  The AddCardSet is activated   
by the +Add button.  

One or more AddCardSets are associated with a particular   
CardSet.  As such, the AddCardSet(s) must immediately   
follow the particular CardSet. The user has the option of   
executing the associated AddCardSet(s) by activating the  
+Add button, or skipping the AddCardSet(s) by activating   
the Next button.  

The AddCardSets to provide  optional information that   
serves to clarify the information provided by a CardSet.    

The following  CardSet asks the user to enter the capital of Ohio.    

		c
		d Capital of Ohio is: (# $capital)
		
In the case of a user who "knows" the answer but cannot quite recall     
it, a hint or a probe would be beneficial, perhaps something like:  

		Discover of the New World

An AddCardSet providing the hint or probe must be optional.  Users   
knowing the answer should not be encumbered with unneeded information.  

The hint or probe CardSet is assigned to the '+Add' button.   
User activation of this button presents the following commands:   

		+
		d Discover of the New World

The tag '+' is the leading command of the AddCardSet.  

The following commands includes two AddCardSets associated  
with the CardSet seeking the answer: Columbus.  

		c
		d Capital of Ohio is: (# $capitalOh)
							.
		+
		d Discover of the New World
							.
		+
		d Answer begins with C and has 8 letters 
							.
		c 
		d Capital of New York is (# capitalNY)
		...


A CardSet that has associated one or more AddCardSets arms the        
'+Add' button.  Its color becomes yellow.   

The user who answers the Ohio question and does not activate the      
'+Add' button skips the AddCardSets and is presented with the   
New York question.   

The user activating the Add button twice is presented the first    
and second AddCardSets. The +Add button remains enabled. When    
activated again, then the associated CardSet is re-executed.  

Thus, the user, equipped with the addition information of the   
AddCardSets, is given the opportunity to respond appropriately   
to the question.   

In a series of AddCardSet, activation of the Next button returns  
the user to the associated CardSet.
