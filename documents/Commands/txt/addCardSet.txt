AddCardSet
=================

An Add Card Set has the same functionality as a Card Set.  
However, it does not begin with the 'c' command. Instead,  
it begins with the 'b' command that also clears the  
screen.  

The Sets differ by their controlling button.  The Add  
Card Set is activated by the +Add button and are termed  
AddCardSets.  The user, activating the Next button, may   
elect to skip the AddCardSets.  

One or more Add Card Sets is associated with a particular  
Card Set.  A script developer may utilize the AddCardSets   
to provide  optional information that serves to clarify the   
information provided by a CardSet.  

The following  CardSet asks the user to enter the capital of Ohio.  

		c
		d Capital of Ohio is: (# $capital)
		
In the case of a user who "knows" the answer but cannot quite recall   
it, a hint or a probe would be beneficial.  Something like:  

		Person who discovered the New World

An Add Card Set providing the hint or probe must be optional.  Users   
knowing the answer should not be encumbered with unneeded information.

The hint or probe CardSet is assigned to the '+Add' button.  
User activation of this button presents the following commands: 

		b
		d Person who discovered the New World

The tag 'b' is the leading command of the AddCardSet.  The 'b'   
command has the same functionality as the 'c' command.   

The following commands includes an additional Button CardSet:  

		c
		d Capital of Ohio is: (# $capitalOh)
							.
		b
		d Person who discovered the New World
							.
		b
		d Answer begins with/and ends with,
		d and has 8 letters:
		d         C o l _ _ b u s
							.
		c 
		d Capital of New York is (# capitalNY)
		...

The AddCardSets must immediately follow the CardSet to which   
they are associated.  In the above script, the  two Add  
CardSets relate only to the Ohio capital question and not  
the subsequent New York question.  

A CardSet that has associated one or more AddCardSets arms the      
'+Add' button.  Its color becomes yellow.   

The user who answers the Ohio question and does not activate the   
'+Add' button skips the AddCardSets and is presented with the   
New York question.  

Activation of the '+Add' button in the Ohio question CardSet has   
the same affect has hitting the 'Next' button. That is, the   
following AddCardSet is executed.   

The user activates the 'Next' button in both AddCardSets.   

Activation of the 'Next' button in the last AddCardSet   
restores the CardSet associated with the AddCardSets.   

The initial CardSet is again executed. Hopefully, the user has been   
provided with enough supplemential informaton to answer the Ohio   
question.
