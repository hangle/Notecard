Group Command
=============

The Group command, with the tag 'g' and a logic component, controls whether or   
not a group of Card Set commands execute.   The following script shows two   
Group commands. One Group command suceeds; the other fails.  

<pre>
        c                     c
        d now                 d now
        d is                  d is
        g (1) = (1)           g (1) = (2)
        d the                 d the
        d time                d time
        c ...                 c  ...        
</pre>

In the case of 'g (1)=(1)', the following commands are executed:  
    
		d the  
		d time  

In the case of 'g (1)=(2), these commands are skipped.  

The scope of Group command extends to the end of the Card Set, or until another   
'g' tag is encountered, for example  

<pre>
        c                     c
        d now                 d now
        d is                  d is
        g (1) = (1)           g (1) = (2)
        d the                 d the  
        g                     g
        d time                d time
        c ...                 c  ...        
</pre>

In the left hand script, all 'd' commands will execute.  In the right hand script,   
all 'd' commands will execute with the exception of 'd the'.  The tag 'ge' may   
follow a Group command with a logic component. When the logic component fails,   
then the group of commands following the 'ge' tag are executed.  

<pre>
        c                     c
        d now                 d now
        d is                  d is
        g (1) = (1)           g (1) = (2)
        d the                 d the  
        ge                    ge
        d time                d time
        c ...                 c  ...       
</pre>
 
In the left-hand script, the 'd the' command is executed but not the 'd time'   
command.  In the right-hand script, the 'd time' command is executed but not   
the 'd the' command.
