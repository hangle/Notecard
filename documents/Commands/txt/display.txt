Display Command
===============

The Display command renders text within the Notecard window.  It also captures   
the user's input or response.  The 'd' command's text occupies one line of the   
Notecard window.  The 'd' command is line oriented; it does not wrap.  A space  
must follow the 'd' tag if subsequent components are included (see optional   
components).  

The Display or 'd' command has six optional components:  

		(1) Column/Row  placement  of a line of text  
		(2) Text appearance arguments covering the line of text  
		(3) Text line  
		(4) Input field  
		(5) Display of $(variables)  
		(6) Text appearance of a subset of the text line  

The simplest 'd' command is:  

		d   

This command has just  the 'd' tag (no trailing space required).  It renders an   
empty text line.  

_______________________________________________________________________

Column/Row  Placement component  
________________________________________________________________________

This component has two optional arguments:  row and column values.  
Row value controls the text line placement within the Notecard window.  
Column value controls the column where the text line begins.  

A component having both Column and Row requires the column value to begin   
without a slash '/' but to end with a slash.  

The row value has both a beginning and ending slashes:  

		d 20/5/this text is displayed on the 5th row, beginning in column 20  

A component having just the column value.  

		d 15/this text begins in column 15  

A component with a column value establishes the column position of subsequent   
'd' commands or until a 'd' commands establishes a new column position:  
 
		d 20/begins in column 20  
		d begins in column 20, next row  
		d begins in column 20, next row   
		d 15/begins in column 15, next row  
		d begins in column 15, next row  

A component having just the row value:  

		d /14/this text is on row 14, beginning in column 1.  

A display command without the row value  has its row value automatically   
incremented by the system.   

		c  
		d this line begins on row 1  
		d this line begins on row 2  
		d this line begins on row 3

Text appearance arguments covering the line of text  
______________________________________________________________________

The Appearance  component consist of  a "type" "value" pair where  
the pair is enclosed in slashes.  The component may consist of multiple  
pairs.   

<pre>
              Type                           Value

             name             font name   e.g., TimeRoman
             size             size of lettering,   e.g., 14
             color            color of lettering   e.g., black 
             style            normal, bold, or italic
</pre>

Component with one type/value pair:  

		d /color blue/all letters are colored blue  
		d /size 16/all letter have the same size  
		d /style bold/all letter are in bold type  

Component with multiple type/value pairs:  

		d /color blue/size  16/style bold/ a line with color, size, and style  

The appearance features of:  

		name  
		size  
		color  
		style  

can be applied to one or more words of the text line.  

In the script example, the appearance pair (color, blue) is applied   
to (for all).  

		d now is the (%% /color blue/ for all) good men  

Again (color, blue) is enclosed in slashes, i.e.,  /color blue/.  
The appearance subset is enclosed in parentheses and the open parenthesis is   
followed by the tag '%%'.  

Multiple appearance pairs can be applied to a subset of line words.  
Multiple subsets of line words can be incorporated, for example:  

        d (%%/color blue/now is) the (%%/style bold/time for) all good men.  

____________________________________________________________________________

Display of $(variables)  
____________________________________________________________________________

Variables that have been captured or assigned by the Assigned 'a' command can  
be displayed on the text line.  Suppose in one Card set that the value 'male'   
was assigned to $gender via the command:  

		a $gender=male  

Another Card set can display  'male' with:  

	d The client's gender is (% $gender)  

The component is enclosed in parentheses and the open parenthesis is followed   
by '%'.  

The appearance features of:  

		name  
		size  
		color  
		style  

can be applied to the displayed $(variable), for example:  


		d The client's gender is (% /color blue/size 20/ $gender)  

____________________________________________________________________________

Input Field component  
____________________________________________________________________________


In the Display command, enclosing a $(variable) expression in parentheses   
where the open parenthesis is followed by the '#' symbol, for example:  

		d Enter your gender (# $gender)  

causes an input field to be rendered on the text line. Following the execution   
of the Card set, control is passed to the input mechanism. Focus is given to   
the input field, and the user types a response. The 'enter' key causes the   
response value to be stored in $gender.  A display command may have up to 32   
input fields. The following has two input fields:  

		d Enter your gender (# $gender) and age (# $age)  

The appearance features of:  

		name  
		size  
		color  
		style  

can be applied to one or more words of the text line.  

		d Enter your gender (# /color red/ $gender)  

The color red is applied to the letters the user types.  The Input field component   
has two additional type-value pairs. These are:  

<pre>
            length              size of the input field
            limit               number of input character allowed.
</pre>

All appearance features have default values. The name/value components overrides   
these default values. In the case of the limit type-value pair, a limit value of   
1 forces the processing of the input mechanism after the user' s first letter is   
entered. For example:  

		d Enter 'y' or 'n' (# /limit 1/length 1/ $yesNoAnswer)  

The problem with the above 'd' command is that an entry of letters other than   
'y' and 'n' would be captured. The Edit command would resolve this problem.  
The following commands display a field length of 1 and limits the user input to   
a single letter. It also allows the single letter to be either a 'y' or 'n'.  

		d (#yn $male) Are you a male  
		d (#yn $over60) Are you over 60  

The Input Field component's open parenthesis '(' is followed by the tag '#yn'.  
A specialized Input Field component is available to handle multiple choice   
answers where the choices are numbered from 1 to n. In this case, the Input   
Field component's open parenthesis '(' , it is followed by #n, where n is the   
number of choices. The input mechanism rejects any answer that is not in the   
range of 1 to n. For example:  

		d Indicate the direction (#4 $directon)  
		d 20/1. North  
		d 2. East  
		d 3. West  
		d 4. South
