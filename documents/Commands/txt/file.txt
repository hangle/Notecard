File Command
===========

The script of Notecard commands are in files with the '.nc' extension. The file   
command establishes a link between '.nc' files. The File command's tag is 'f',   
followed by one or more spaces, and then the name of the '.nc file it is linked   
to, for example:  

		f myProgram  

Note: the '.nc' extension is dropped.  

When the File command is encounter, then execution passes to the designated '.nc'   
file. In the above example, the first Card Set of 'myProgram.nc' is processed.  
In this linkage, when the file is not found, control passes to the Start window,   
where a Card Set will ask, via an input field,  for a '.nc' filename.  The   
Start window script is similar to the following:  

		c  
		d Enter a filename (# $filename)  
		f $filename  

The example illustrates that the File command my have a $<variable> whose value   
is treated as a filename.  The File command my have an optional Logic component   
that controls whether or not the command is executed. For example:  

		f maleQuestions ($gender) = (male)  
		f femaleQuestions  

In the above, if the client or student is not male, then then execution passes   
to the script in the femaleQuestions.nc file.  The logic component is involved   
and is described in the Logic Component page.  The File command is not a command     
member of the Card Set. It is placed following a Card Set. In many cases it is    
found at the end of a '.nc' file
