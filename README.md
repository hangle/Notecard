<h1>Notecard Program</h1>

<p>The Notecard presents a window about the size of a note card.  The window displays text <br />
to and accepts input from the program user (see example: www.notecard.org/document). <br />
The text and response capture are controlled by a script file of eight command types.  </p>

<p>Run (src directory):  </p>

<pre><code>    scala card demo/card
</code></pre>

<pre>
                           'scala card' executes the Notecard program.  In the argument 
                           'demo/card/', 'card' is a script file in the 'demo' directory. 
                           Execution illustrates the capabilities of the script commands.

                           These capabilities can also be viewed at:
