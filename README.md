<h1>Notecard Program</h1>

<p>The Notecard presents a window about the size of a note card.  The window displays text <br />
to and accepts input from the program user (see example: www.notecard.org/document). <br />
The text and response capture are controlled by a script file of ten command types <br />
(see documents/Command directory).    </p>

<pre><code>    scala card demo/card

<pre>
                      'scala card' executes the Notecard program.  In the argument 
                      'demo/card/', 'card' is a script file ('card.struct) in the 
                      'demo' directory. Execution illustrates the capabilities of 
                      the script commands.

<h2>Script repository:</h2>

<p>The input file, 'card.struct', to Notecard is generated by the program 'script.scala' <br />
(see Script repository).  This program converts the script commands in files having <br />
the '.nc' extension to the commands of Notecard files having the '.struct' extension.  </p>

<p>An essential role of the script program is to validate the script commands.   </p>
